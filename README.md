## Image Upload

Images for menu items are uploaded using multipart/form-data through Multer. The images are stored in Cloudinary. The field name for the image is `image`.

## Roles and Access Control

The API distinguishes between two user roles: `customer` and `admin`. Customers can register, log in, place orders, and submit reviews. Admins have additional privileges such as managing menu items, viewing orders and statistics, and moderating reviews and contact messages.

## Technology Stack

This project is built using Node.js and Express on the backend. MongoDB is used for data storage, and Mongoose handles data modeling. Authentication is handled using JWT. Image upload is handled via `multipart/form-data` and stored in Cloudinary.

## Testing

You can test this API using tools like Postman or Thunder Client. When calling protected routes, be sure to include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer <your-token>`.
